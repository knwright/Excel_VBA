Createed a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
It also displays the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

Created a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

  * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

  * The total Volume of the stock

  * Ticker symbol

Also includes conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The solution also locates the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

Made the appropriate adjustments to the script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
